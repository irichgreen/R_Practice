This folder contains supplementary materials (data, R code, and an explanatory PDF document) for the paper "Statistical Modelling of Citation Exchange Between Statistics Journals" by C Varin, M Cattelan and D Firth.

The explanatory PDF document is
         JRSS-PR-SA-Dec-13-0008_supplement.pdf

The data files are all comma-separated text files, which can be opened by (for example) many spreadsheet programs.

The main R script file, which replicates the analyses presented in the paper, is 
         JRSS-PR-SA-Dec-13-0008_supplement.R
Section numbers in that file are as in the explanatory PDF document.

Before running the R code in that file, the following R "add-on" packages should be installed (from one of the CRAN repositories):
         "car", "qvcalc", "BradleyTerry2", "plotrix"
