# Welcome to shinyData!

With shinyData, you can easily load a data set from a file or with custom R code, manipulate its properties (change column formats, names, etc.), slice and dice it as you wish and visualize the results, all within a graphical user interface. The outputs are updated instantaneously with each input change. You can also create reports and presentations from your results, downloadable in a variety of different formats. Lastly, shinyData also supports saving and loading of projects so you can save your partial work to resume later, or share your work with others by simply sending them the project file.

If this is your first time using the tool, we strongly recommend you explore some of the sample projects found on the top right corner of this page.
